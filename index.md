 1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
    - The most interesting topic covered in my domain was the introduction of personas. I didn't know that you could extract different personalities from a dataset and then use ChatGPT to emulate those personalities and answer questions as these personalities. I think this really opened my eyes to a whole new use case for these chat models and I just found it really cool how it could turn itself into different personalities.\
