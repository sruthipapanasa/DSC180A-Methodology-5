 **1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
    - The most interesting topic covered in my domain was the introduction of personas. I didn't know that you could extract different personalities from a dataset and then use ChatGPT to emulate those personalities and answer questions as these personalities. I think this really opened my eyes to a whole new use case for these chat models and I just found it really cool how it could turn itself into different personalities.
      
 **2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
    - A potential investigation I would like to pursue for my Quarter 2 project is using these personas to do predictive analysis. We are doing this in the quarter one project in the political sector by trying to see what different personalities may think of different political policies. But, I want to see if this predictive analaysis can be useful in other areas as well.
      
 **3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
    - One potential change is maybe researching the costs of different tools beforehand. My team and I would just try different tools we thought were useful and sometime ran up the cost. So I think next time I would just like to be more mindful and do more research before trying out different tools.
      
 **4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
    - Another technique I would be interested in using would be more data visualizations. We learned a lot of different visualization techniques and different types of plots in DSC 106 and I would like to incorporate those into the project.
